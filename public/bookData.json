      "review": "\n  \"Once There Were Wolves.\" Was a book I was going into blindly. I wasn't expecting to like it other than there are wolves within the pages. But then I started reading. Some parts were boring, and hard to get through because of it, but once you get through the short boring parts you get to the mystery and suspense the book really holds.<br><br>Without spoiling I want to add that this book left me wondering the whole \"who had done it,\" sort of question. And in the end I was left surprised. It's a great book, I definitely recommend it to anyone who enjoys a little bit of darkness and mystery. But beware, SPOILER, there is mentioning of abuse and rape, for any who are sensitive to those subjects.\n"

      "review": "\n  Charlotte McConaghy’s talent astounds me.  She is clearly on an urgent mission to force human beings to rectify the damage we have done to our planet.  But, she manages to do it with stories that are so layered, complex, and above all, beautifully written, that it matters not whether you think you will be invested in the plight of Arctic terns as in MIGRATIONS or in this case, wolves.<br><br>“When we were eight, Dad cut me open from throat to stomach.”  With that incredible first line, we meet Inti, and learn that she has a rare condition called Mirror-Touch, Synethsia, which means she physically feels anything happening around her. When her dad is skinning a rabbit, it feels as if she herself is being cut. We also learn that she has a twin sister, Aggie, with whom her bond is stronger than the normal twin bond.The two have come to the Scottish highlands because Inti is a wolf biologist and she and her team have been charged with reintroducing wolves to the area, as a vital part of saving the forests. Of course, the locals are mostly against wolves, seeing them as violent and dangerous, though Inti tries to prove otherwise. As Inti and her team do their work, McConnaghy skillfully weaves together the stories of the sisters, the locals, and the wolves.  Her language is gorgeous, precise, and visceral. I honestly can’t say I’ve read a more beautiful book.  It is a haunting story that leaves you pondering violence,  love, connection, and the nature of animals and humans alike. I am 99% sure this will be my favorite book of 2021\n"

      "review": "\n  Inti Flynn has never been ordinary.  She feels everything and she feels it in a way that most people could never fathom. Growing up, she and her twin sister split their time between two worlds - their mother’s in the deafening city of Sydney and their father’s in the lush green forests of British Columbia.<br><br>The trees always called to her in the same way that they did her father.  They made her feel whole and alive.  It’s that very feeling that was to determine the trajectory of her life. She just has to be careful not to let it drive her to that same kind of madness that eventually stole him away.<br><br>She’s come to Scotland in search of healing – both for her sister and for the Highlands.  Her goal as a biologist with the Cairngorms Wolf Project is to reintroduce the wolves back into the surrounding area in hopes of slowing the effects of climate change and to breathe life into it once more.  But some of the residents only see wolves as mindless killers and they are willing to back up that belief with bullets.<br><br>So every single day, Inti must navigate the perilous lines between scientific truth, idealism, and the dark heart of man. And she soon come face to face with the terrible knowledge that there is a predator lurking inside us all.<br><br>Once There Were Wolves will literally change the way that you perceive all the living world.  Charlotte McConaghy has somehow managed to capture the very essence of what it means to co-exist alongside nature in a way that I’ve never experienced before.<br><br>Every aspect of the story is perfect in its synchronicity - from her broken characters in all their visceral anger, to the verdant landscapes, and the fearlessness of the wolves themselves. It sparked with an intensity that left me feeling an unexpected combination of fury and hope.  And I know now, that deep down, we are all capable of being a little monstrous…<br><br>Favorite Quote - “Don’t fool yourself into thinking you can predict a wolf. That’s dangerous. She will always surprise you.”\n"

## Positive anticipation - and the Pulp Fiction trade-off

Back in the days before the Internet streaming of everything, older amongst us will remember with a palpable portion of nostalgia all the excitement related to the ways media like the books, comics, movies or (Hi-Fi Dolby stereo) music were consumed. For many, the process was initiated much before we read, watched or listened to the "long-awaited goodies", and the waiting time involved was, by definition, **the positive anticipation**.

Nowadays, the impatience to watch the latest Netflix hit-piece episode or listen to the live-streaming Spotify podcast exceeds only the countless form&shapes of entertainment itself struggling to each other for our attention 24-7.

## Shared Anticipation - and the Benefits of not Being Locked-down

A wise man said, "Candies are always more delicious while behind the storefront window". It applies in particular to the rest of us, fans of good literature, still hooked to the haptic sensation of holding an actual book in our hands, sniffing between the pages and tidying our bookshelf with pride and joy (and a bit of a prejudice) every once in a while.

And as with mentioned candies, the secret ingredient in finding the next reading masterpiece has always been a good old **word of mouth**. You would finish reading the great novel, and then it would be one of the prominent conversation topics in any social gathering situation. Depending on the event format, you would share the recommendation with your acquaintances or total strangers. Usually, in return, you would get a bunch of good suggestions for your next must-read book. Not to mention new lifetime friendships or even beyond that. Why not?

As regards word of mouth - it is more and more just words over the broadband internet connections without in-person seeing the mouth that utters it whatsoever. Think about the social implications for a sec.

## No Anticipation - just Another Excitement Buster Shot.

So the question is: Are we really enjoying our books, movies or music to the full extent now that it's all readily available? Is there a tangible cost for all that abundance and instant accessibility that we are paying willingly?

Let's think of **a viable alternative** that reconciles all the good, bad and not-worse aspects of the technology with our still present instinct of being entertained in reasonably digestible chunks. Let us be consumers with positive anticipation again, instead of just being positively consumed all day long by social media and everyday hectic life experiences.

## Digital Anticipation - let the ReadsOmnia usher in!

ReadsOmnia was born in the somewhat large and rounded head of a 50 years old freshman as the direct result of these first-hand experiences & prolonged contemplation. Considering the decent lifespan and the fact that he-me was a witness of the times, not to forget my professional connection to the online dystopia by being an Internet marketing & development expert from the very time of conception of these terms, I found myself embroiled in the secret mission.

> The mission of ReadsOmnian is to well-serve all of you - passionate readers alike, by bringing the good old word of mouth concept to the digital world you are surrounded with. By using the best of the cutting edge technology and AI to search from all corners of the Internet, every major literature outlet and community forum, let the technology help us meander the digital literature jungle out there, bringing to us only the best of the best to pick - "how, when and where" on our terms.

## ReadsOmnia anticipation - what makes it different?

You may say: "nothing new here. I already knew some similar services, so what is the difference?"

We use information from all those services and beyond to moderate the collection of unique fiction and non-fiction titles. Those that matter, that everyone speaks about around the corner, and those on numerous selfies on Instagram, Twitter, LinkedIn, those that that acclaimed critics would pay you to read, and those that users of other services discuss thoroughly and in great length but never reach to the front pages or get the mainstream recognition.
